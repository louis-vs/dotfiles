# dotfiles

This repo contains my personal dotfiles collection, written for macOS.

## Usage

Clone the repo (e.g. into `~/dotfiles`), then run `make` to install symlinks to your `$HOME` directory. To remove symlinks, run `make delete`.

By default, commands affect all packages. Specify the `packages` variable to run `stow` on particular packages, e.g. `make delete packages=zsh`.

**NB make sure to run `make` whenever you add a new file or package to ensure that it's picked up.**

You can prefix files that start with a dot with `dot-` instead so they aren't treated by your system as hidden files.

You can use `make adopt` to pull files into stow packages. Careful with this â€“ you probably want to specify specific packages when you do this. Consider manually running stow with `-n -v` first to see what it will do.

To add a new package, first create the files you want to include into a new folder, or move files that already exist here. Then run `make packages=<new package name>` to create symlinks.

Some programs (e.g. GnuPG) might require you to fiddle with permissions after you clone the repo and run stow.
